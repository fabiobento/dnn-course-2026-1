Question 1
What is a perceptron in the context of neural networks?
- A type of activation function used in neural networks
- * The simplest form of a neural network, consisting of a single neuron
- A multi-layer neural network
- A large dataset used for training complex models

Question 2
What is the purpose of an activation function in a neural network?
- To increase the model's learning rate
- To initialize network parameters
- To reset network weights
- * To introduce non-linearity into the model

Question 3
What is the forward pass in neural networks?
- * The phase where input data is passed through the network to generate output
- The process where parameters are randomly initialized
- The process of gradient calculation and weight updates
- The phase where data is cleaned and preprocessed

Question 4
In backpropagation, what is the role of the loss function?
- To compute the forward pass efficiently
- * To measure the difference between predicted and actual values
- To increase the network's learning speed
- To add new layers to the network dynamically

Question 5
How do neural network weights change during training?
- Weights change at random to explore possible solutions
- Weights are manually set by the user after each epoch
- * Gradients calculated during the backward pass guide the adjustment of weights
- Weights are fixed after initialization
